# Obsidian Project sample vault

This is a sample vault for Obsidian.md as a project manager. I have used a ton of plugins to make this possible, and it has most of the features dedicated apps have.

# Features
- Gantt, List, Calendar, and Kanban view
- Wiki pages
- Goals, Action items, and Milestones
- Each item is stored in its own file to enable extensive metadata
- Subtasks and complex relationships
- Prebuilt dropdown menus for the metadata
- Whiteboarding with Obsidian Canvas or Excalidraw
- Webpage saving
- Time tracking

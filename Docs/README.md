# Obsidian.md Project Management Sample vault

This is my sample vault for project management. I use [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/), as well as many plugins to make this setup work. Currently this supports most features found in dedicated project managers, enabling plain markdown project management. The one lacking feature is ease of use, with all the separate task views I have I cannot drag and drop easily. I have to manually edit the task dates and metadata.

# Features
- Gantt charts
- Kanban boards
- Calendar view
- List view
- Wiki pages
- Action items
- Goals
- Milestones
- Each action item/goal/milestone is its own file enabling rich metadata for each task
- Git version control
- Task database
- Whiteboarding
- Time tracking
- Webpage saving

# Description:
This is a list of improvements that I can make on my Gantt Timeline view. I am keeping this list off the calendar because it is a meta topic (discussion on the discussion itself, or in my case, notes on the task management software itself instead of the tasks it hosts).

- [ ] Add a default start and end date for tasks that don't have any, instead of skipping
- [x] Display milestones even without any tasks ⏫ ✅ 2024-01-11
- [ ] Shorten long names automatically
- [ ] Fix the bug where it will list all incoming links of type task. I couldn't find an immediate solution.
- [ ] Add an original date to Extended date feature.
